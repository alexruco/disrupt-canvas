# disrupt-canvas
A framework to serve as a business design, communication, and decision support tool

A business idea doesn't need to be expected to "come" from nowhere, itÂ´s nothing you simply "have": a business idea can be a result 
of an intentional approach over a problem to be solved. 

This work intends to serve as a guideline to academic, professional, and even personal projects, to help to give them a business opportunity approach.
